# Leeches Always Bite Twice
## Version 1.0.0

by Corsair83 - Greatness7 - Melchior Dahrk - Ruffin Vangarr - Tewlwolow
Made for the Morrowind May Modathon 2023
Week 4 Challenge - Occult and Noir

### Description
The swamps of Vvardenfell are more dangerous than ever with leeches as large as a mer's forearm latching onto unwary adventurers (and NPCs) who stray into the murky waters of the Bitter Coast. Although leeches are a common issue in the coastal region, a detective in Balmora is looking for an assistant to help solve a mysterious string of cases related to the bloodsucking worms...

This mod originated in 2022 when I saw another modder (Lucevar) carelessly trudging through scum ponds in the Bitter Coast and I thought it looked like a good way to get leeches. I made a simple MWscript mod where you could get leeches by going into muck ponds. Then the mod expanded into MWSE where Greatness7 helped me visually attach leeches to the player and started coding complex physics for when the leeches fall off of the player. The mod sat idle until Modathon 2023 and the 4th week challenge came around and we decided to jam this leech mod into the Noir + Occult category. So in addition to the leech feature, this mod also comes with a leech-related quest powered with writing from Corsair83, new outfits from Ruffin Vangarr, and sound effects + music from Tewlwolow. The mod was a bit rushed due to the time constraints, but we hope you enjoy Leeches Always Bite Twice!

#### Features
* Leeches visually attach to the player when in water on the Bitter Coast
* Shake leeches off by swinging your arms and watch physics drop them to the ground
* Leeches drain health and prevent you from sleeping

### Playing
To start the mod, look for a note on the door of the Lucky Lockup. If you get stuck during the quest, consider training up your Speechcraft. The detective needs someone with the skill to interview people!

Disclaimer: due to time constraints, the 1.0.0 release of this mod only contains Part 1 of the quest. We'll leave you on a cliff hanger, but we're already working on Part 2 to finish the storyline! The leech feature of the mod is fully complete.
